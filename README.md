# eye-Witness


eyeWitness: A safety application using an interactive map to show crime hotspots.
  
  - eyeWitness notifies users about the crime rate in their current location, including details on types of crimes and their frequency so that they can take precautions.
  - Addresses unreported offenses affecting city residents and tourists, such as pickpocketing, thievery and harassment etc, which are large in number and difficult for police to handle.
